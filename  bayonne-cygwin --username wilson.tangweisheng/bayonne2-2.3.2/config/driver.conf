[sip]
; default options and overrides for Bayonne 2 SIP driver

; localnames is used to activate virtual hosting and anonymous calling
; support.  If no localnames is present, then all user agents are
; treated as "local" and require registration.  If localnames is set to
; a list of hosts/domains, then only user agents which claim to be from
; the "local" domains have to register, and the rest are allowed so long
; as at least one "type=anon" entry exists in sip.conf
;localnames = localhost mydomain.com etc...

; stack size to use for driver thread, 0 is automatic set
;stack = 0

; number of event dispatch threads to use, we pick 5 by default
;threads = 5

; event buffer for queing event dispatch.  This should actually be
; a multiple of the total number of SIP timeslots.  Hence large values
; are desired.  The default value shown here is based on the default engine
; assignment of 32 timeslots.
;buffer = 128

; priority of driver sip thread.  May need to be higher with lots of
; ports.
;priority = 0

; audio encoding format to use.  currently supports mulaw, alaw, and gsm.
;encoding = mulaw

; audio encoding format to use when peer calling if not specified
;peering = mulaw

; framing size to use.  For gsm this is ignored, as gsm is always 20.  For
; ulaw and alaw, 10, 20, or 30 milliseconds are considered valid values.
;framing = 20

; you may be able to change rtp rate.  I would not suggest doing this.
;rate = 8000

; payload id.  0 if statically assigned based on encoding type.
;payload = 0

; dtmf id for rfc 2833 dtmf payload mapping.  set to 0 to ignore 2833.
;dtmf = 101

; set to true to enable inband dtmf detection.  currently broken.
;inband = false

; linear threashold for automatic silence supression.  This effects record
; vox and silence operations, and should be used when the gateway or
; distant end does not automatically surpress silent packets for you.  The
; value of 500 is based on audiotool linear levels, not db.
;silence = 500

; jitter is the number of frames to time in the jitter buffer.  The default
; used is 2.
;jitter = 2

; interface sip presents itself on and used for forming default uri's
; this is automatically set by default, but can be given a useful value
; there.
;interface = 127.0.0.1:5070

; add silence filler packets rather than supressing audio when true'
;filler = false

; rtp port number.  If not specified, then starts sip + 4.  RTP ports
; are assigned and reused by timeslot mapping, with each port starting
; 4 from the previous timeslot.  Hence, if you have a sip port of 5070
; and 4 sip timeslots, and wish to port forward through a NAT, you can
; port forward a single contingues block of UDP ports from 5070-5089.
;rtp = 5074

; time interval to wait for ack after answering a SIP call, in milliseconds.

; sip proxy server to use or override from server.conf/[engine]

; to force outbound proxy; do not use sip:, that is automatically set
;outbound = xxxx[:port]

; to use immediate (yes) or time synchronize qued rtp packet sends
;immediate = yes

; starting mode, delayed (hiwater), immediate (preallocate), or only 
; when active
;starting = delayed

[h323]
; h323 driver options, there are a lot

; driver event queue for msgport thread.  The same advice as in the
; sip driver applies here as well.
;events = 128

; hangup latency timer.  Sometimes h323 needs time for cleanup at end of
; call.  In milliseconds.

; wait time for connection start when picking up incoming call, in milliseconds
;pickup = 4000

; offer time for connection, in milliseconds
;offer = 4000

; Interface to bind under.  If not specified, or the default port number
; is in use, the server will try port numbers + 10, and + 20 for you
; automatically.  Very useful when testing with gnomemeeting on the same
; machine.

; Gatekeeper options to enable and configure.  Leftovers from old version,
; probably will be cleaned up to match sip such as userid, proxy, and

[soundcard]

; number of rings to answer calls on.  Use at least 2 if you have analog
; callerid service.

; noringback call progress analysis timer, in milliseconds.

; duration of ringback for call progress analysis, in milliseconds.
