Thanks to Peter Wang <tjaden@psynet.net> for libcda which gave me the
idea for structuring a C++ CDAudio class and a lot of useful portable
code to start from.

Jason Spence <jrs@ostel.com> fixed wave/RIFF support, added the
getErrorStr() and getAbsolutePosition() APIs, and began documenting
the API for use by programmers with no prior experience dealing with
digital audio.
