This is the first stable release of Bayonne 2.  This release is derived
from the 0.9.5 release, with a number of features that were either still
in active development or experimental removed, including Troll gateway
support, and ivrscript job control.

This release is mostly to offer a stable base platform for building script
driven ivr applications using the Bayonne 2 ivrscript language and core
runtime engine.  This distribution includes only those drivers which are
themselves supplied on a free software license, including the Bayonne 2
sip driver built from the GPL licensed eXosip package, the h323 driver
built from the MPL licensed OpenH323 stack, the Voicetronix driver
built from the LGPL licensed voicetronix sdk, and the CAPI soundcard
driver for GNU/Linux CAPI support.  

Other drivers are available separately in the "bayonne2-nonfree"
package, which is freely offered, but includes drivers that are "non
free" in terms of their licensing.  This separation is similar to the
nonfree (as in freedom) debian repository, rather than non-free as in
cost.  The nonfree drivers include Dialogic, Synway, and aculab drivers,
all of which are also still in development.
