Description: GTK+ config frontend for the iODBC Driver Manager
 The iODBC (intrinsic Open Database Connectivity) driver manager is
 compatible with the ODBC 2.x and 3.x specification and performs all
 the jobs of a ODBC driver manager (i.e. driver loading, parameters and
 function sequence checking, driver's function invoking, etc). Any ODBC
 driver working with ODBC 2.0 and 3.x driver manager will also work with
 iODBC driver manager and vice versa.
 .
 Applications (using ODBC function calls) linked with iODBC driver
 manager will be able to simultaneously access different types of data
 sources within one process through suitable iODBC drivers.
 .
 This package contains the configuration binaries.
