How to build iODBC for Mac OS X
===============================


Method 1: Using Project builder
-------------------------------

You first need to install the latest Mac OS X Developer Packages,
which can be found at:

	http://developer.apple.com/tools


Then execute the following commands from a terminal session to build
all the frameworks and demo applications:

	$ cd mac
	$ make


After building the iODBC libraries and applications, you have to
install them on your system with the command:

	$ sudo make install


This installs the iODBCinst and iODBC frameworks into:

	/Library/Frameworks

and the test applications iodbctest and iodbctestw into:

	/Library/Application Support/iODBC/bin

and the iODBC Administrator and the iODBC Demo applications in:

	/Applications/iODBC


Now that you have installed the iODBC frameworks on your system,
you are able to use ODBC applications or build your own applications
using the iODBC API.


Once you have installed an ODBC driver and configured a DSN, you
will be able to make a connection using the iodbctest command which
is located in:

	/Library/Application Support/iODBC/bin/iodbctest



Method 2: Using configure and make
----------------------------------

The iODBC package can also be build like any other Open Source package
not using any frameworks.

To build the libraries, open up a terminal session and execute the
following commands:

	$ sh bootstrap.sh
	$ ./configure
	$ make

To install the header files and libraries in /usr/local, you execute
the following command as administrator:

	$ sudo make install

Note that this will build all code based that only runs on the CPU
type you build it on, so PowerPC on older systems, 32bit Intel on
early CoreDuo machine and 64bit on current models. 

However iODBC can also be configured to build a universal library that
works with all 3 models embedded.

The following commands will build a release of iODBC that works on
both Mac OS X 10.5 as well as Mac OS X 10.6:

	$ CFLAGS="-O -arch ppc -arch i386 -arch x86_64"
	$ CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk"
	$ CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -mmacosx-version-min=10.5"
	$ export CFLAGS
	
	$ sh bootstrap.sh
	$ ./configure \
		--disable-dependency-tracking \
		--prefix=/usr/local/iODBC.universal

	$ make
	$ sudo make install

Once you have installed an ODBC driver and configured a DSN, you
will be able to make a connection using the iodbctest command which
is located in:

	/usr/local/iODBC.universal/bin/iodbctest
