From ccscript 4.1.2 to 4.1.3
- added support for cmake builds.

From ccscript 4.1.1 to 4.1.2
- abi expansion to accomidate both const and non-const string processing.

From ccscript 4.1.0 to 4.1.1
- fixed install of scripts.
- man page for ccscript-config.

From ccscript 4.0.5 to 4.1.0
- use of %var[xx] for array access!  Internally same as $find/xx:var for
  named dictionaries and $offset/xx:var for numeric offsets.
- use of %var(xx) for offset access.  Interally becomes $index/xx:var.
- use of %var<xx> for "mapping" %xx as array index.
- new $map/xx:var dictionary/offset search using the value of mapped sym xx.
- correct compiler restrictions when using special if-then clauses.
- pre-increment and pre-decrement can now be done with ++%var and --%var.
- pull/pop declation as <<%xx and >>%var (same as $pull:var and $pop:var).
- local method calls added, very useful in templates for common code blocks.
- expr handling fixed and extended for direct symbol assignment.
- "immediate expressions" shortcut for format operations by reference.
- '#' is now a "mod" operator; cannot be used as comment, only %% and // now.

From ccscript 4.0.5 to 4.0.6
- merged compile member function to compose images.

From ccscript 4.0.4 to 4.0.5
- perl style expression operators for strings (eq, ne, gt, lt, ge, le).
- support for nested tuples (parenthetic).
- new expand keyword to unpack tuples into variables.
- for & foreach consolidated into for with foreach behavior.

From ccscript 4.0.3 to 4.0.4
- $key: to extract tuple key, $val: can get a tuple value as well as numeric.
- basic tuple list manipulation, including push, $pop: and $pull:.
- push keyword to add tuple to end of list cleanly.

From ccscript 4.0.2 to 4.0.3
- added "requires" to conditionally compile based on keywords available.
- improved comment extraction with tabs.
- added list management convenience functions.
- special symbol "%index" to get index count of current for/foreach loop.
- added "previous" and "repeat" for use in "for" and "foreach" loops.
- added "index" command to set index offset in "for" and "foreach" loops. 
- added optional offset argument to "foreach" command, can auto-reset.

From ccscript 4.0.1 to 4.0.2
- added "expr" for simple math expressions.
- simplified internal list processing.
- added new $offset/x:var expansion for list processing.  If "x" is not pure
  numeric, then is symbol indexed offset.
- allow assignment expression syntax with set, for := and +=, for consistency
  with "expr" command.

From ccscript 4.0.0 to 4.0.1
- apply command added to allow script "templating".
- fix for bug when accessing event that does not exist.
- use of local ^exit to override global @exit

Initial Release 4.0.0
